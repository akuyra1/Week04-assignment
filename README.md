# Week04-assignment
Build a Full Stack Application: Visitor Guestbook


Workshop
User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to visit the website and read the information on my phone or computer
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to leave a message in the guestbook
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to see all of the messages that have been left in the guestbook
Requirements
🎯 Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.
    
🎯 Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.

🎯 Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form

🎯 Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table

🎯 Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database

🎯 Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

Stretch Goals
🏹 Add a delete button to each message, that sends a request to the server to delete the message

🏹 Add a like button to each message, that sends a separate request to the server to increment the likes on the message








Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.
(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
    - Made a form on index.html
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
    - Did not meet most of the requirements
    - Did not attempt to style as I wanted to make the form work first and then style later, but since it isn't working I didn't work on styles at all.
🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    -I don't know where I went wrong, I keep getting into loops of confusion on what does what and what means what.
      Kept trying to solve my errors by testing on already existing biscuit database in supabase, but I cant get it to appear on the page as I can't remember how to render it at all. I feel like I have too many gaps in understanding and remembering week04 content. I rewatched and reviewed week04 content but I still couldn't make it work.
(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
    - Just feeling owerwhelmed on this side of the learning, feels like i understand some aspects, but clearly far from where I should be, kept going through it but just felt more and more anxious and unsucessful with it. 
    The more I read about it and tried changing my code around just made everything more confusing and unclear where the issue is. 

    
What went really well and what could have gone better?
